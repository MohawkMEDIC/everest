Notes About Processing Delta Sets:

1. Type representation is done using non-structured strings. This regex works pretty well 
with non-generic types:
^(\w+)?<?([A-Za-z\.\<\,]+>?)?>$

Basically we have to turn IVL<RTO<PQ,PQ>> into:

TR : IVL 
	TP : RTO
		TP	: PQ
		TP	: PQ
		
Which is done as follows:

RE Group	0		1				Action
Pass 1:		IVL		RTO<PQ,PQ>		0 into TR1 name
									RTO<PQ,PQ> to be processed
Pass 2:		RTO		PQ,PQ			0 into TR2 name
									Assign PQ as TP to TR2
Pass 3:		PQ,PQ	NO MATCH		Split and return two TR(3,4) of PQ
Pass 2:								Assign TR(3,4) as type parameters to TR2
Pass 1:								Assign TR2 as type parameter to TR1

Function for correcting data types will be called recursively until the
second group in the regex no longer contains '<'. The results from the 
child call will be placed as a type parameter to the parent.
