                     <mif:p> Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations, and they connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations indicate the performers, authors, and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (including tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes among Acts that are meant as factual records, records of intended or ordered services, and other modalities in which acts can be recorded. </mif:p>
                  </mif:text>
               </mif:usageNotes>
               <mif:rationale>
                  <mif:text>
                     <mif:p> Acts are the pivot of the RIM: domain information and process records are represented primarily in Acts. Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>An Act-instance represents a "statement," according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.] </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>An activity in the real world may progress from definition, through planning and ordering to execution: these stages are represented as the moods of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing through these stages, the "attributable statement" model of Act entails that this progression be reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood, and that this mood not change during the Act-instance's life cycle. This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow recipients of the information to compare actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category "sequel"). </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Acts as statements are the only representations of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through the combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent "objective state of affairs" or "real processes" independent from attributed statements. A factual statement may be made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, e.g. a surgical procedure report, clinic note, etc. Similarly, a status update may be made about an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer), and later superseded by a full procedure report. Both status update and procedure report are acts, distinguished by mood and state (see Act.statusCode) and completeness of information: neither has any epistemological priority over the other except as judged by the recipient of the information. </mif:p>

                        <mif:p>To describe the progression of a business activity from definition to planning to execution, etc., one must instantiate Act-instances in each of the required moods and link them using ActRelationship of general type "sequel." (See ActRelationship.typeCode.)</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Since the mood code is a determining factor for the meaning of an entire Act object, the mood must always be known. This means that whenever an act object is instantiated, the mood attribute SHALL be assigned to a valid code, and the mood assignment SHALL NOT change throughout the lifetime of the act object.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The Act.moodCode modifies the meaning of the Act class in a controlled way, just as in natural language, grammatical form of a verb modifies the meaning of a sentence in defined ways. For example, if the mood is factual (event), then the entire act object represents a known fact. If the mood expresses a plan (intent), the entire act object represents the expectation of what should be done. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>As the meaning of an Act-instance is factored in the mood code, the mood code affects the interpretation of the entire Act object and with it every property (attributes and associations). Note that the mood code affects the interpretation of the act object, and the meaning of the act object in turn determines the meaning of the attributes. However, the mood code does not arbitrarily change the meaning of individual attributes.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Acts have two kinds of act properties, inert and descriptive. Inert properties are not affected by the mood, but descriptive properties follow the mood of the object. For example, there is an identifier attribute Act.id, which gives a unique identification to an act object. Being a unique identifier for the object is in no way dependent on the mood of the act object. Therefore, the "interpretation" of the Act.id attribute is inert with respect to the act object's mood.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>By contrast, most of the Act class attributes describe what the Act statement expresses. Descriptive properties of the Act class answer the questions who, whom, where, with what, how and when the action is done. The questions who, whom, with what, and where are answered by Participations, while how and when are answered by descriptive attributes and ActRelationships. The interpretation of a descriptive attribute is aligned with the interpretation of the entire act object, and controlled by the mood. </mif:p>

                        <mif:p>To illustrate the effect of mood code, consider a "blood glucose" observation.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The Definition mood specifies the Act of "obtaining blood glucose." Participations describe in general the characteristics of the people who must be involved in the act, and the required objects, e.g., specimen, facility, equipment, etc. involved. The Observation.value specifies the absolute domain (range) of the observation (e.g., 15-500 mg/dl).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>In Intent mood the author of the intent expresses the intent that he or someone else "should obtain blood glucose." The participations are the people actually or supposedly involved in the intended act, especially the author of the intent or any individual assignments for group intents, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.). The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the intent is to measure blood glucose, not to measure blood glucose in a specific range. (But compare with GOAL below).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>In Request mood, a kind of intent, the author requests "please measure blood glucose." The Participations identify the people actually and supposedly involved in the act, especially the order placer and the designated filler, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.). The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the order is not to measure blood glucose in a specific range.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>In Event mood, the author states that "blood glucose was measured." Participations indicate the people actually involved in the act, and the objects actually involved (e.g., specimen, facilities, equipment). The Observation.value is the value actually obtained (e.g., 80 mg/dL, or &lt;15 mg/dL).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>In Event Criterion (not to be confused with Criterion) mood, an author considers a certain class of "obtaining blood glucose" possibly with a certain value (range) as outcome. The Participations constrain the criterion, for instance, to a particular patient. The Observation.value is the range in which the criterion would hold (e.g. &gt; 180 mg/dL or 200-300 mg/dL).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>In Goal mood (a kind of criterion), the author states that "our goal is to be able to obtain blood glucose with the given value (range)." The Participations are similar to those in Intent mood, especially the author of the goal and the patient for whom the goal is made. The Observation.value is the range which defines when the goal is met (e.g. 80-120 mg/dl).</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>Act.code is not a required attribute of Act. Rather than naming the kind of Act using an Act.code, one can specify the Act using only the class code and other attributes and properties of the Act. In general and more commonly, the kind of Act is readily specified by an ActRelationship specifying that this Act instantiates another Act in definition mood. Even without reference to an act definition, the act may be readily described by other attributes, ActRelationships and Participations. For example, the kind of SubstanceAdministration may be readily described by referring to the specific drug, as the Participation of an Entity representing that drug.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other. The Act.code concept should imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code "potassium" together with and Act.classCode for "laboratory observation" to somehow mean "potassium laboratory observation" and then use the same Act.code for "potassium" together with Act.classCode for "medication" to mean "substitution of potassium". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.</mif:p>

                     <mif:text>
                        <mif:p>An indicator specifying that the Act statement is a negation of the Act in Event mood as described by the descriptive attributes.</mif:p>
                     </mif:text>

                     <mif:text>
                        <mif:p> The actionNegationInd works as a negative existence quantifier on the actual, intended or described Act event. In Event mood, it indicates the defined act did not occur. In Intent mood, it indicates the defined act is not intended/desired to occur. In Criterion mood, it indicates that the condition is based on the non-occurrence of the event. It is nonsensical to have a negationInd of true for acts with a mood of definition.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The actionNegationInd negates the Act as described by the descriptive properties (including Act.code, Act.effectiveTime, Observation.value, Act.doseQty, etc.) and any of its components. The document characteristic properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, Act.confidentialityCode, and particularly the Author-Participation are <mif:b>not</mif:b> negated. These document characteristic properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains to be the author of the negative observation. Also, most ActRelationships (except for components) are not included in the negation. Refer to the attribute isDocumentCharacteristic property and the ActRelationshipType and ParticipationType code system isDocumentCharacteristic properties for specific guidance.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>For example, a highly confidential order written by Dr. Jones, to explicitly <mif:b>not</mif:b> give "succinyl choline" for the "reason" (ActRelationship) of a history of malignant hyperthermia (Observation) negates the descriptive properties "give succinyl choline" (Act.code), but it is still positively an order and written by Dr. Jones and for patient John Smith, and the reason for this order is the patient's history of malignant hyperthermia.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>However, additional detail in descriptive attributes will be part of the negation which then limits the effectiveness of the negated statement. For example, had the order "not to give a substance" included a doseQuantity, it would mean that the substance should not be given at that particular dose (but any other dose might still be O.K.).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>An act statement with actionNegationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated "patient had an appendectomy on July 1" means that the author positively denies that appendectomy occurred on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation. Conversely, the action negation indicator does <mif:b>not</mif:b> just negate that the fact was affirmed or that the statement had been made. This holds for all moods in the same way, e.g., a negated order is an order <mif:b>not</mif:b> to do the described act, not just the lapidary statement that there is no such order. Such lapidary statements are handled by negating the control act that created the subject act. I.e. "An order of this type (DEFN mood) with an author of Dr. Smith was not created."</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Note that for Observations, actionNegationInd indicates that the act itself did not occur. I.e. no observation took place. To indicate that an observation did occur but the finding was negative, use Observation.valueNegationInd.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>An indication that the Act statement is a negation of the Act as described by the descriptive attributes.</mif:p>

                     <mif:text>
                        <mif:p>The negationInd works as a negative existence quantifier. This is best explained on Acts in criterion mood, and then translates into all other moods. In criterion mood without negation, one usually only specifies a few critical attributes and relationships (features) of an Act, i.e., only those that are needed to test the criterion. The more features one specifies, the more constrained (specific) is the criterion. For example, to test for "systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg," one would use only the descriptive attributes Act.code (for systolic blood pressure) and Observation.value (for 90-100 mm Hg). If one would also specify an effectiveTime, i.e., for "yesterday," the criterion would be more constrained. If the negationInd is true for the above criterion, then the meaning of the test is whether a systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg yesterday does <mif:b>not exist</mif:b> (independent of whether any blood pressure was measured).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The negationInd negates the Act as described by the descriptive properties (including Act.code, Act.effectiveTime, Observation.value, Act.doseQty, etc.) and any of its components. The inert properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, Act.confidentialityCode, and particularly the Author-Participation are <mif:b>not</mif:b> negated. These inert properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains to be the author of the negative observation. Of ActRelationships , only components are included in the negation. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>For example, a highly confidential order written by Dr. Jones, to explicitly <mif:b>not</mif:b> give "succinyl choline" for the "reason" (ActRelationship) of a history of malignant hyperthermia (Observation) negates the descriptive properties "give succinyl choline" (Act.code), but it is still positively an order and written by Dr. Jones and for patient John Smith, and the reason for this order is the patient's history of malignant hyperthermia. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>However, additional detail in descriptive attributes will limit the effective scope of the negation. For example, had the order not to give a substance included a doseQuantity, it would mean that the substance should not be given at that particular dose, but does not prohibit medication at any other dose.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>An act statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated "finding of wheezing on July 1" means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation. Conversely, negationInd does <mif:b>not</mif:b> just negate that the fact was affirmed or that the statement had been made. This holds for all moods in the same way, e.g., a negated order is an order <mif:b>not</mif:b> to do the described act, not just a statement that there is no such order.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>The status reflects the state of the activity. In the case of an Observation, this is the status of the activity of observing (e.g., "new," "complete," "cancelled"), not the status of what is being observed (e.g., disease status, "Active" allergy to penicillin). To convey the status of the subject being observed, consider coordinating it into the code or value attribute of the Observation or using a related Observation.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>The effectiveTime is also known as the "primary" time (Arden Syntax) or the "biologically relevant time" (HL7 v2.x). This attribute is distinguished from activityTime.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>For observations, the time of the observation activity may be much later than the time of the observed feature. For instance, in a Blood Gas Analysis (BGA), a result will not be available for several minutes after the specimen was taken, meanwhile the patient's physiological state may have changed significantly. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>For essentially physical activities (surgical procedures, transportations, etc.), the effective time is the time of interest for the Act's intention, i.e., since the intention of a transportation is to deliver a payload from location A to B, the effectiveTime is the time this payload is underway from A to B. However, the Act usually also includes accidental work which is necessary to perform the intention of the Act, but is not relevant for the Act's purpose. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>For example, the time a driver needs to go to the pick-up location A and then return from drop-off location B to some home base, is included in the physical activity (as activityTime), but it does not matter from the perspective of the payload's transportation and is excluded from effectiveTime. Another example: a person's work hours (effectiveTime) may be from 8 AM to 5 PM, no matter whether that person needs 10 minutes for the commute or 2 hours. The commute is necessary to be at work, but it is not part of the working time.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>A time expression specifying when an Observation, Procedure, or other Act occurs, or, depending on the mood, is supposed to occur, scheduled to occur, etc. The activityTime includes the times of component actions (such as preparation and clean-up).

                        <mif:p> The activityTime is primarily of administrative rather than clinical use. The clinically relevant time is the effectiveTime. When an observation of a prior symptom is made, the activityTime describes the time the observation is made, as opposed to effectiveTime which is the time the symptom is reported to have occurred. Thus the activityTime may be entirely different from the effectiveTime of the same Act. However, even apart from clinical use cases, designers should first consider effectiveTime as the primary relevant time for an Act.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>ActivityTime indicates when an Act occurs, not when it is recorded. Many applications track the time an observation is recorded rather than the precise time during which an observation is made, in which case Participation.time (e.g. of the Author) should be used. These recorded observations can take place during an encounter, and the time of the encounter often provides enough information so that activityTime isn't clinically relevant.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>ActivityTime is a descriptive attribute: like effectiveTime, it always describes the Act event as it does or would occur. For example, when a procedure is requested, the activityTime describes the requested total time of the procedure, which may differ from the time recorded for the resulting event. By contrast, the author Participation.time is inert, i.e., author participation time on an order specifies when the order was written and has nothing to do with when the event might actually occur.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>It is important to note that the necessary confidentiality of the medical record cannot be achieved solely through confidentiality codes to mask individual record items from certain types of users. There are two important problems with per-item confidentiality: one is inference and the other is the danger of holding back information that may be critical in a certain care situation. Inference means that filtered sensitive information can still be constructed from the information that was not filtered. The simplest form of inference is that even the existence of a test order for an HIV Western Blot test or a T4/T8 lymphocyte count is a strong indication for an existing HIV infection, even if the results are not known. Very often, diagnoses can be inferred from medication, such as Zidovudin for treatment of HIV infections. The problem of hiding individual items becomes especially difficult with current medications, since the continuing administration of the medication must be assured.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Managing the display of confidential information is a task for clinical applications, but the data structure must support the ability to indicate the existence of such information to appropriate persons. To mitigate some of the inference-risk, aggregations of data should assume the confidentiality level of the most confidential action in the aggregation. The boundary of an aggregation is context-dependent and is not formalized in this specification.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p> The ActRelationship class is used to construct systems of acts to represent complex observations, action plans, and to represent clinical reasoning or judgments about action relationships. Prior actions can be linked as the reasons for more recent actions. Supporting evidence can be linked with current clinical hypotheses.

                     <mif:p>Every ActRelationship instance is like an arrow with a point (headed to the target) and a butt (coming from the source).

In a reason-relationship the source is any Act and the target is the reason or indication for the source-Act. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of the source act object.

                     <mif:text>
                        <mif:p> The ActRelationship class is used to construct a variety of semantic structures, including panels, action plans, and representations of clinical reasoning or judgments. Prior actions can be linked as the reasons for more recent actions. Supporting evidence can be linked with current clinical hypotheses. Problem lists and other networks of related judgments about clinical events are represented by the ActRelationship link. The typeCode implies specific constraints on what kinds of Act objects can be related and in what way.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The types of act relationships fall under 6 categories: </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>1) Composition, with composite (source) and component (target). One of the most commonly used ActRelationship types is "has component" to describe the composition and de-composition of Acts. The relationship type allows specifying detail of Acts to varying degrees. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The composition relationship can group actions into "batteries," e.g., LYTES, CHEM12, or CBC, where multiple routine laboratory tests are ordered as a group. Some groupings, such as CHEM12, may be defined by a specific implementation; others, such as blood pressure, seem to naturally consist of systolic and diastolic pressure. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>With the composition relationship, the detail of Acts can be revealed to different levels for different purposes without the structure of the Act hierarchy needing to be rearranged. This allows supporting multiple viewpoints on the same business processes. For instance, a billing viewpoint of a laboratory test battery may be as a single billable act. A clinician's view of the same laboratory test battery is as a set of individual observations, where the ordering among the observations is irrelevant. The laboratory's view of this act will be more detailed, including action plan steps that are never reported to the clinician (e.g., centrifugation, decantation, aliquoting, running certain machines, etc.). The laboratory's viewpoint warrants a thorough specification of action plans (that can be automated). During this specification, more and more nested sub-activities will be defined. Still, the source Act is the same, with varying degrees of detail uncovered in the de-composition relationship. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>2) Sequel, which includes follow-up, fulfillment, instantiation, replacement, transformation, etc., for which source and target are Acts of essentially the same kind but with variances in mood, and where the target exists before the source. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>3) Pre-condition, trigger, reason, contraindication, with the conditioned Act ("give aspirin") at the source and the condition or reason Act ("if fever above threshold") at the target. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>4) Post-condition, outcome, goal and risk, with the Act at the source having the outcome or goal at the target. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>5) Workflow. The composition and sequence relationships can be arranged in a sequence to form temporal and conditional (non-temporal) action plans (e.g., care plan, critical path, clinical trials protocols, drug treatment protocols). There is a group of attributes in both Act and ActRelationship called the "workflow Control suite of attributes" that allow the detailed specification of executable action plans. These attributes are</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>Humans often rely on context when interpreting information. For example, when reading a report taken from a folder containing a patient's medical record, the reader will infer that the report deals with the patient, even if there is no direct reference to the patient on the form. However, other pieces of information, such as the author of the folder (the hospital that maintains it) may sometimes apply to the contents of the folder (e.g., a report generated by a doctor at the hospital) and other times not (e.g., a copy of a report from another institution). Humans are quite good at making the necessary inferences about what context should be propagated from an item to something within that item. However, incorrect inferences can occur (perhaps the report in the patient's record deals with a relative). Furthermore, computers have substantially more difficulty making such inferences, even though they can be essential for decision-support systems.</mif:p>

In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Before each step is executed, those with preconditions have their conditions tested; where the test is positive, the Act has clearance for execution. The checkpointCode specifies when the precondition is to be checked; it is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages "while-do" vs. "do-while" or "repeat-until" vs. "loop-exit."</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>For all checkpointCodes except "end," preconditions are being checked at the time when the preceding step of the plan has terminated and this step would be next in the sequence established by the sequenceNumber attribute. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>When the checkpointCode for a criterion of a repeatable Act is "end," the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that Act. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>When the checkpointCode is "entry," the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition, if any, whereas "beginning" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition "loop" starts.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The checkpointCode "through" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see Act.interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The checkpointCode "exit" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan. Such exit criteria are sequenced with the other plan components using the ActRelationship.sequenceNumber.</mif:p>

In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. The splitCode specifies whether a branch is executed exclusively (case-switch) or inclusively, i.e., in parallel with other branches. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>In addition to exclusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as "guard conditions" on the branch) are evaluated. A "try once" guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely, execution of a "wait" branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>In exclusive wait branches, the first branch whose guard conditions turn true will be executed and all other branches abandoned. In inclusive wait branches some branches may already be executed while other branches still wait for their guard conditions to turn true.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes. An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. Branches are parallel if the splitCode specifies that more than one branch can be executed at the same time. The joinCode then specifies if and how the branches are resynchronized.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The principal re-synchronization actions are (1) the control flow waits for a branch to terminate (wait-branch), (2) the branch that is not yet terminated is aborted (kill-branch), (3) the branch is not re-synchronized at all and continues in parallel (detached branch).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>A kill-branch is only executed if there is at least one active wait branch. If there is no other wait branch active, a kill-branch is not started at all (rather than being aborted shortly after it is started). Since a detached branch is unrelated to all other branches, active detached branches do not prevent a kill-branch from being aborted.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p> This attribute is used primarily for clarifying statements. As the examples show, the use of this attribute is quite limited, notably contrast this with the Act.negationInd that actually requires that the described Act not exist, not be done, etc. whereas the ActRelationship.negationInd merely negates this relationship between source and target act, but does not change the meaning of each Act. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Note also the difference between negation and the contrary. A contraindication is the contrary of an indication (reason) but not the negation of the reason. The fact that lower back pain is not a reason to prescribe antibiotics doesn't mean that antibiotics are contraindicated with lower back pain.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>Upon evaluation, the criterion is passed if all "and" criteria are true. If "or" and "and" criteria occur together, one criterion out of the "or"-group must be true and all "and" criteria must be true also. If "xor" criteria occur together with "or" and "and" criteria, exactly one of the "xor" criteria must be true, and at least one of the "or" criteria and all "and" criteria must be true. In other words, the sets of "and", "or", and "xor" criteria are in turn combined by a logical "and" operator (all "and" criteria and at least one "or" criterion and exactly one "xor" criterion). To overcome this ordering, Act criteria can be nested as necessary.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p>An association between an Act and a Role. The Entity playing the Role is the actor. </mif:p>
                  </mif:text>
               </mif:definition>
               <mif:usageNotes>
                  <mif:text>
                     <mif:p> Each Entity involved in an Act is linked to the Act by one Participation-instance. The kind of involvement in the Act is specified by the Participation.typeCode.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The Entity's Role interposes between the Entity and the Participation. While Roles represent the competence of an Entity, Participations represent performance, so a Participation is scoped by its specific Act, and only incidentally by its Entity. Conversely, Roles describe an innate quality of an Entity (i.e., how it may principally participate in acts), irrespective of any individual Act.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The professional credentials of a person (Role) may be quite different from what a person actually does (Participation). A common example is interns and residents performing anesthesia or surgeries under (more or less) supervision of attending specialists: the role of intern does not specify the nature of the participation.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>An Act can have multiple participations of the same type: this indicates collaborative activities or group involvement. The notion of multiple performing Participations MAY also be represented as sub-activities (Act components): the presence of multiple actors MAY be represented as an act composed of sub-acts where each act has only one performing actor, or as a single act with many participations.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>For example, a record of a surgical service may include the actors of type (a) consenter, (b) primary surgeon, and (c) anesthetist, and these three Roles might have separate Participation relationships to the surgery. Alternatively, these three actors really perform different tasks, which can be represented as three related acts: (a) the consent, (b) the surgery proper, and (c) the anesthesia act in parallel to the surgery. If we used the sub-acts, the consenter, surgeon and anesthetist could simply be of actor type "performer." Thus the more sub-acts we use, the fewer different actor types we need to distinguish; conversely, the fewer sub-acts we use, the more distinct actor types (and Participation instances) we need.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>As a rule of thumb, sub-tasks should be preferred to multiple actors when the sub-tasks require special scheduling, or billing, or if overall responsibilities for the sub-tasks are different. In many cases, however, this detail is not urgent enough to support its collection: human resources are scheduled in teams (rather than as individuals), billing tends to lump sub-tasks together, and overall responsibility often rests with an attending physician, chief nurse, or head of department. While the ActRelationship class supports detailed decomposition, the Participation class supports multi-actor "lumping" of sub-activities into a primary act.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p> This class deals only with opportunity and not the outcome of the exposure; i.e. not all exposed parties will necessarily experience actual harm or benefit.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Exposure differs from Substance Administration by the absence of the participation of a performer in the act. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The following participations SHOULD be used with the following participations to distinguish the specific entities:</mif:p>
                     <mif:ul>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:p>The exposed entity participates via the "exposure target" (EXPTRGT) participation.</mif:p>
                        </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:p>An entity that has carried the agent transmitted in the exposure participates via the "exposure source" (EXSRC) participation. For example: </mif:p>
                           <mif:ul>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>a person or animal who carried an infectious disease and interacts (EXSRC) with another person or animal (EXPTRGT) transmitting the disease agent;</mif:p>
                              </mif:li>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>a place or other environment (EXSRC) and a person or animal (EXPTRGT) who is exposed in the presence of this environment.</mif:p>
                              </mif:li>
                           </mif:ul>
                        </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:p>When it is unknown whether a participating entity is the source of the agent (EXSRC) or the target of the transmission (EXPTRGT), the "exposure participant" (EXPART) is used.</mif:p>
                        </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:p>The physical (including energy), chemical or biological substance which is participating in the exposure uses the "exposure agent" (EXPAGNT) participation. There are at least three scenarios:</mif:p>
                           <mif:ol>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is the chemical or biological substance mixed or carried by the scoper-entity of the Role (e.g., ingredient role); or </mif:p>
                              </mif:li>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is a mixture known to contain the chemical, radiological or biological substance of interest; or </mif:p>
                              </mif:li>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>the player of the Role that participates as a EXPAGNT is known to carry the agent (i.e., the player is a fomite, vector, etc.).</mif:p>
                              </mif:li>
                           </mif:ol>

                     </mif:ul>
                     <mif:p>The Exposure.statusCode attribute should be interpreted as the state of the Exposure business object (e.g., active, aborted, completed) and not the clinical status of the exposure (e.g., probable, confirmed). The clinical status of the exposure should be associated with the exposure via a subject observation.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p>The usage notes require a clear criterion for determining whether an act is an exposure or substance administration-deleterious potential, uncertainty of actual transmission, or otherwise. SBADM states that the criterion is the presence of a performer-but there are examples above that call this criterion into question (e.g., the first one, concerning a dosing error).</mif:p>

                     <mif:p>The following examples are provided to indicate what interactions are considered exposures rather than other types of Acts:</mif:p>
                     <mif:ul>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:p>A patient accidentally receives three times the recommended dose of their medication due to a dosing error. </mif:p>
                           <mif:ul>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>This is a substance administration. Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with an associated exposure.</mif:p>
                              </mif:li>
                           </mif:ul>
                        </mif:li>
                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:p>A patient accidentally is dispensed an incorrect medicine (e.g., clomiphene instead of clomipramine). They have taken several doses before the mistake is detected. They are therefore "exposed" to a medicine that there was no therapeutic indication for them to receive. </mif:p>
                           <mif:ul>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>There are several substance administrations in this example. Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with associated exposures.</mif:p>

                        <mif:li>
                           <mif:p>In a busy medical ward, a patient is receiving chemotherapy for a lymphoma. Unfortunately, the IV infusion bag containing the medicine splits, spraying cytotoxic medication over the patient being treated and the patient in the adjacent bed. </mif:p>
                           <mif:ul>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>There are three substance administrations in this example. The first is the intended one (IV infusion) with its associated (implicit) exposure. There is an incident with an associated substance administration to the same patient involving the medication sprayed over the patient as well as an associated exposure. Additionally, the incident includes a substance administration involving the spraying of medication on the adjacent patient, also with an associated exposure.</mif:p>

                           <mif:p>A patient who is a refugee from a war-torn African nation arrives in a busy inner city A&amp;E department suffering from a cough with bloody sputum. Not understanding the registration and triage process, they sit in the waiting room for several hours before it is noticed that they have not booked in. As soon as they are being processed, it is suspected that they are suffering from TB. Vulnerable (immunosuppressed) patients who were sharing the waiting room with this patient may have been exposed to the tubercule bacillus, and must be traced for investigation. </mif:p>
                           <mif:ul>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>This is an exposure (or possibly multiple exposures) in the waiting room involving the refugee and everyone else in the waiting room during the period. There might also be a number of known or presumed substance administrations (coughing) via several possible routes. The substance administrations are only hypotheses until confirmed by further testing.</mif:p>

                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>This is an exposure to MRSA. Although there was some sort of substance administration, it's possible the exact mechanism for introduction of the MRSA into the wound will not be identified.</mif:p>

                           <mif:p>Routine maintenance of the X-ray machines at a local hospital reveals a serious breach of the shielding on one of the machines. Patients who have undergone investigations using that machine in the last month are likely to have been exposed to significantly higher doses of X-rays than was intended, and must be tracked for possible adverse effects. </mif:p>
                           <mif:ul>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>There has been an exposure of each patient who used the machine in the past 30 days. Some patients may have had substance administrations.</mif:p>

                           <mif:p>A new member of staff is employed in the laundry processing room of a small cottage hospital, and a misreading of the instructions for adding detergents results in fifty times the usual concentration of cleaning materials being added to a batch of hospital bedding. As a result, several patients have been exposed to very high levels of detergents still present in the "clean" bedding, and have experienced dermatological reactions to this. </mif:p>

                                 <mif:p>There has been an incident with multiple exposures to several patients.

                           <mif:p>Seven patients who are resident in a facility for the care of the elderly mentally ill have developed respiratory problems. After several months, during which various tests are performed and various medications prescribed to the patients, the problem is traced to their being "sensitive" to a new fungicide which has been used in the plaster of the walls of the ward they are patients on. </mif:p>
                           <mif:ul>
                              <mif:li>
                                 <mif:p>The patients have been continuously exposed to the fungicide. Although there have been continuous substance administrations (via breathing) this would not normally be documented as a substance administration.</mif:p>

                           <mif:p>A patient with osteoarthritis of the knees is treated symptomatically using analgesia, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1g up to four times a day for pain relief. His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use. Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice. Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought. The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring. </mif:p>

                                 <mif:p>There is a substance administration with an associated exposure. The exposure component is based on the relative toxic level of the substance to a patient with a compromised liver function.</mif:p>

                           <mif:p>A patient goes to their GP complaining of abdominal pain, having been discharged from the local hospital ten days' previously after an emergency appendectomy. The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve. The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment. At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass. A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity. Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place. </mif:p>

They are hurrying down the second floor corridor. A sudden summer squall has recently passed over the area, and rain has come in through an open corridor window leaving a small puddle on the corridor floor. In their haste, the patient slips in the puddle and falls so badly that they have to be taken to the A&amp;E department, where it is discovered on investigation they have slightly torn the cruciate ligament in their left knee. </mif:p>

                        <mif:p>If the route requires further specification, both the site of administration (administrationSiteCode) and the method of administration (methodCode) from the associated SubstanceAdministration may be used.

Route, site of administration (administrationSiteCode), method of administration (methodCode) and the device used in administration are closely related. All four (if present) must be closely coordinated and in agreement. In some cases, the coding system used to specify one may pre-coordinate one or more of the others. </mif:p>

                        <mif:p>Specification of countable units can be handled with the following techniques: </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(1) Specify the countable unit in the InvoiceElement.code. That is, a specific InvoiceElement.code would indicate that the item referenced by the act represents a box of 20 items. If the InvoiceElement.code represents a box of 20 items, and the InvoiceElement.unitQuantity = 2 (units), then this represents 2 boxes of 20 items for a total of 40 items.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(2) If more detail is required (e.g. to describe the composition, packaging, or manufacturer of a product), then use a participation (typeCode = "PRD") and a combination of role and entity classes to describe the details of the packaging.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Each InvoiceElement that is being charged or billed is identified by a charge or bill code (InvoiceElement.code). In some situations, this code is a pre-coordinated code set and represents a container (e.g., UPC code for a container of 1000 pills and another UPC code for a container of the same pills but in a container of 100). The UPC code is used in invoicing, but ratios are required to specify that only a portion of the container (e.g., bottle) is being billed or charged-for example, 15 pills in a container size of 1000 pills. In this case, the numerator can be expressed as "15 {pill}" or simply "15" and the denominator can be expressed as "1000 {bottle}" or simply "1000." If the InvoiceElement does not reference a container, then the denominator is not specified. </mif:p>

                        <mif:p>Confirm reorganization. Reference to "Data Types Part II Unabridged Specification, Appendix A:Unified Code for Units of Measure" is a dead end. UCUM can be found in the DT document, so an updated reference would help, but it does not help with the restriction on 'unit' representations, which are not prohibited by that specification. Presentation note: the Regenstreif UCUM page from the Regenstreif domain is presented within the V3 ballot frame. Even if there is an MOU for this, the context is confusing to viewers. It should be presented in a new window, if presented. Recommendation: add UCUM reference to the introduction section on related documents or to the Datatypes document; remove from attribute descriptions.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>The simplest formula for deriving gross amounts is: unitQuantity * unitPriceAmount = netAmt. The concept of a Factor allows for a discount or surcharge multiplier to be applied to a monetary amount. For example, the above formula with a factor would be: unitQuantity * unitPrice * factorNumber = netAmt. This concept is frequently used in Europe to adjust the charge between that used for the public system and that used for private insurers. </mif:p>

                     <mif:p> ManagedParticipations are defined as a subclass of Participations because not all Participations are stateful. In general, when the sub-activity realized by a Participation is of closer interest and needs to be managed, one SHOULD instead model that sub-activity as an Act component of the main Act. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>However, in certain environments, the activities that the participants perform is not very well understood, and hence modeling those as sub-acts is deemed burdensome, and it may imply an unmerited depth of knowledge or certainty.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Therefore, the ManagedParticipation extends Participation with an identity-attribute and a state-attribute to support these exceptional use cases. ManagedParticipations should be used with utmost caution so as to avoid confusion with Acts and to avoid having to duplicate the act-management infrastructure around participations.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p>An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject.</mif:p>

                  <mif:text>
                     <mif:p>The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The <mif:b>code</mif:b> attribute of Observation and the <mif:b>value</mif:b> attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a "variable" (a named feature that can assume a value); hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed ("results" or "answers"); and those "results" or "answers" are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves entail a methodology.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Clinical documents commonly have 'Subjective' and 'Objective' findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain 'Assessments,' which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. </mif:p>

                     <mif:text>
                        <mif:p>The appropriate data type of the Observation.value varies with the kind of Observation and can generally be described in Observation definitions or in a simple relation that pairs Act.codes to value data types.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>The following guidelines govern the choice of the appropriate value data type.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(1) Quantitative measurements use the data type Physical Quantity (PQ) in general. A PQ is essentially a real number with a unit. This is the general preference for all numeric values, subject to a few exceptions listed below. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Numeric values MUST NOT be communicated as character strings (ST). </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(2) Titer (e.g., 1:64) and very few other ratios use the data type Ratio (RTO). For titers, the ratio would be a ratio of two integer numbers (e.g., 1:128). Other ratios may relate different quantitative data types, such as a "price" specified in Physical Quantity over Monetary Amount.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Sometimes by local conventions titers are reported as just the denominator (e.g., 32 instead of 1/32). Such conventions are confusing and SHOULD be converted into correct ratios in HL7 messages. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(3) Index values (a number without unit) uses the Real Number (REAL) data type. When a quantity does not have a proper unit, one can just send the number as a real number. Alternatively one can use a PQ with a dimensionless unit (e.g., 1 or %). An integer number should only be sent when the measurement is by definition an integer, which is an extremely rare case and then is most likely an ordinal (see below).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(4) Ranges (e.g., &lt;3; 12-20) must be expressed as Interval of Physical Quantity (IVL&lt;PQ&gt;) or intervals of other quantity data types.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Sometimes, such intervals are used to report the uncertainty of measurement value. For uncertainty, there are dedicated data type extensions available. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(5) Ordinals (e.g., +, ++, +++; or I, IIa, IIb, III, IV) use the Coded Ordinal (CO) data type. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(6) Nominal results ("taxons," e.g., organism type) use any of the coded data types (CD, CE) that specify at least a code and a coding system, and optionally original text, translations to other coding systems, and qualifiers. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(7) Imaging results use the Encapsulated Data (ED) type. The encapsulated data type allows one to send an image (e.g., chest X-ray) or a movie (e.g., coronary angiography, cardiac echo) as alternatively inline binary data or as a reference to an external address where the data can be downloaded on demand. .</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(8) Waveforms can be sent using the Correlated Observation Sequences templates that provide all the data in an HL7 framework. In addition one can use the Encapsulated Data (ED) data type to send waveforms in other than HL7 formats or to refer to waveform data for on-demand download. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(9) The character string data type may exceptionally be used to convey formalized expressions that do not fit in any of the existing data types. However, the string data type SHALL NOT be used if the meaning can be represented by one of the existing data types. </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(10) Timestamps SHOULD NOT be sent in Observations if there are more appropriate places to send them, e.g., usually as Act.effectiveTime of some act. (E.g., "specimen received in lab" is in the effectiveTime of an Act describing the specimen transport to the lab, not in an Observation. .</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(11) Sets of values of any data type, enumerated sets as well as intervals, are often used for Observation criteria (event-criterion mood) to specify "normal ranges" or "decision ranges" (for alerts). </mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(12) For sequences of observations (repeated measurements of the same property during a relatively short time) a Sequence (LIST) data type is used. Refer to the Correlated Observation Sequences specification for more detail.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>(13) Uncertainty of values is specified using the Probability and Probability Distribution data type extensions (UVP, PPD). If a statistical sample is reported with absolute frequencies of categories a Bag collection (BAG) can be used efficiently.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>In all observations the method is already partially specified by simply knowing the kind of observation (Observation.code) and this implicit information about the method does not need to be specified in Observation.methodCode. For example, if Observation.code uses a LOINC code, the method may already be known to a significant degree of precision: many LOINC codes are defined for specific methods when the method makes a practical difference in interpretation. Thus, using LOINC, the difference between susceptibility studies using the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) or the agar diffusion method (Kirby-Baur) are specifically assigned different codes. The methodCode therefore is only an additional qualifier to specify what may not be known already from the Act.code.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p> Applied to clinical medicine, procedure is but one among several types of clinical activities such as observation, substance-administrations, and communicative interactions (e.g. teaching, advice, psychotherapy, represented simply as Acts without special attributes). Procedure does not subsume those other activities nor is Procedure subsumed by them. Notably Procedure does not comprise all Acts of whose intent is intervention or treatment. Whether the bodily alteration is appreciated or intended as beneficial to the subject is likewise irrelevant: what counts is that the Act is essentially an alteration of the physical condition of the subject. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The choice between Procedure and other representations of real activities is based on whether the activity or activity step's necessary post-condition is the physical alteration. For example, taking an x-ray image may sometimes be called "procedure," but it is not a Procedure in the RIM sense, for an x-ray image is not done to alter the physical condition of the body. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Many clinical activities combine Acts of Observation and Procedure nature into one composite. For instance, interventional radiology (e.g., catheter directed thrombolysis) does both observing and treating, and most surgical procedures include conscious and documented Observation steps. These clinical activities therefore are best represented by multiple component Acts, each of the appropriate type.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>For any Procedure there may be several different methods to achieve by and large the same result, but may be important to know when interpreting a report more thoroughly (e.g., cholecystectomy: open vs. laparoscopic). Method concepts can be "pre-coordinated" in the Act definition. There are many possible methods, which all depend on the particular kind of Procedure, so that defining a vocabulary domain of all methods would be difficult. However, a code system might be designed that specifies a set of available methods for each defined Procedure concept. Thus, a user ordering a Procedure could select one of several variations of the act by means of the method code. Available method variations may also be defined in a master service catalog for each defined Procedure. In act definition records (Act.moodCode = DEF), the methodCode attribute is a set of all available method codes that a user may select while ordering, or expect while receiving results.</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>For Substance Administrations, the routeCode frequently conveys the method. This attribute is only needed if the routeCode requires further specification. For example, if the routeCode is "by mouth", no further information about the method may be required. If, however, routeCode is intravenous or intra-muscular, the precise method of administration may be specified in this attribute (e.g., "slow bolus injection" or "Z-track injection" respectively).</mif:p>
                        <mif:p>Route of administration (routeCode), site of administration (approachSiteCode) and the method of administration are closely related in Substance Administrations. All three (if present) must be closely coordinated and in agreement. In some cases, the coding system used to specify one may pre-coordinate one or more of the others.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p>The public health case typically involves an instance or instances of a reportable infectious disease or other condition. It can include a health-related event concerning a single individual, or it may refer to multiple health-related events that are occurrences of the same disease or condition of interest to public health. A public health case definition (Act.moodCode = "definition") includes the description of the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic indicators associated with a disease or condition of interest to public health. There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not. There are also case definitions for outbreaks. A public health case definition is a construct used by public health for the purpose of counting cases, and should not be used as clinical indications for treatment.</mif:p>

If the consumable has a non-countable dosage form (e.g., measured in milligrams or litres), then the dose must be expressed in those units. If the consumable has a countable dosage form (tablets, capsules, "eaches"), then the dose must be expressed as a dimensionless count (i.e., with no other unit of measure specified).

An example is the CDC vaccine manufacturer code, modeled as a concept vocabulary, when in fact each concept refers to a single instance. The boundary cases distinguishing codes and identifiers are controversial: this specification allows a certain amount of flexibility.</mif:p>

Many of the attribute definitions are drawn from or make reference to the NCCLS standard. With amorphic substances (e.g., liquids and gases), a container is required. However, the content of a container is always distinguishable and relatively easily separable from the container, unlike the content (ingredient) of a mixture.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p> An Entity participates in an Act in the guise of a particular Role. Note that a particular entity in a particular role can participate in an act in different ways. Thus, a Person in the role of a practitioner can participate in a patient encounter as a rounding physician or as an attending physician. The Role defines the competency of the Entity irrespective of any Act, unlike Participations, which are limited to the scope of an Act. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Each role is "played" by one Entity, called the "player" and is "scoped" by another Entity, called the "scoper". Thus the Role of "patient" may be played by a person and scoped by the provider organization from which the patient will receive services. Similarly, the employer scopes the "employee" role. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The identifier of the Role identifies the Entity playing the role in that role. This identifier is assigned by the scoper to the player. The scoper NEED NOT have issued the identifier, but MAY have re-used an existing identifier. </mif:p>
                     <mif:p>Most attributes of Role are attributes of the playing entity while in the particular role. </mif:p>

                        <mif:p>Confidentiality of the medical record cannot be achieved solely through confidentiality codes to mask individual record items from certain types of users. Filtered sensitive information can often be inferred given information that is not filtered. The simplest form of inference is that even the existence of a test order for an HIV Western Blot test or a T4/T8 lymphocyte count is a strong indication for an existing HIV infection, even if the results are not known. Very often, diagnoses can be inferred from medication, such as Zidovudin for treatment of HIV infections. To mitigate inference-risk, aggregations of data should assume the confidentiality level of the most confidential action in the aggregation.</mif:p>

                        <mif:p>Some containers may have customary ways of referring to the positions; some have no way at all. In the absence of any specific regulation for a specific container type, the rule of thumb is that the coordinate that is changed first is positioned first. For an automated blood chemistry analyzer with a square shaped tray, this means that the first coordinate represents the direction the tray moves at each step, while the second coordinate represents the direction in which the tray moves only periodically.</mif:p>

                     <mif:p>In general, Access is a Role of a ManufacturedMaterial or Device, something specifically manufactured or created to serve that purpose, such as a catheter or cannula inserted into a compartment of the body. Devices in the role of an Access are typically used in intake/outflow observations and in medication routing instructions. Microbiologic observations on the material itself or on fluids coming out of a drain are also common.</mif:p>
                     <mif:p>The Access role primarily exists in order to describe material actually deployed as an access, and not so much the fresh material as it comes from the manufacturer. For example, in supply ordering a box of catheters from a distributor, it is not necessary to use the Access role class, since the material attributes will usually suffice to describe and identify the product for the order. The Access role is used to communicate about the maintenance, intake/outflow, and due replacement of tubes and drains.</mif:p>
