There are some flavors that fundamentally change the output of the datatypes, for example the TS flavours
dictate the precision of the outputted value. However this is not possible from a class design standpoint
as a class cannot dictate its precision on the wire. The formatters will have to take care of this
scenario.

The other problem comes with new flavors that replace old R1 datatypes, for example CV datatype will be 
replaced with CD.CV . This may cause a problem as the core API library has to provide both a CV
and CD with CV flavor validation. 

I believe that this will be possible by the following implementation style:


[Structure(Name = "CV")]
public class CV : CS
{
}

[Structure(Name = "CD")]
[FlavorMap(FlavorId = "CV", Type = typeof(CV))] // map CD.CV to CV
[FlavorMap(FlavorId = "CE", Type = typeof(CE))] // map CD.CE to CE
public class CD : CV
{
}
